SubdomainFinder
SubdomainFinder is a Bash script designed to download and manage validated subdomain resources for given domains. The script provides options for processing single or multiple domains and saving the results into specified output files.

Features
Download validated subdomains for a single domain
Download validated subdomains for multiple domains from a file
Save results to a specified output file
Automatically handles appending results when saving to an output file
Usage
Download validated resources for a single domain and save to output.txt:
bash
Copy code
./subdomain_finder.sh -u target.com -o output.txt
This command will download the validated subdomains for target.com and save them to output.txt.

Download validated resources for multiple domains listed in domains.txt and save to output.txt:
bash
Copy code
./subdomain_finder.sh -d domains.txt -o output.txt
This command will download the validated subdomains for each domain in domains.txt and append them to output.txt.

Download validated resources for a single domain without specifying an output file:
bash
Copy code
./subdomain_finder.sh -u target.com
This command will download the validated subdomains for target.com and save them to target.com_valid_resources.txt.

Download validated resources for multiple domains without specifying an output file:
bash
Copy code
./subdomain_finder.sh -d domains.txt
This command will download the validated subdomains for each domain in domains.txt and save them in individual files.

Example domains.txt
txt
Copy code
example.com
google.com
yahoo.com
Script Execution Examples
Running ./subdomain_finder.sh -u google.com -o output.txt will append the validated subdomains of google.com to output.txt.

Running ./subdomain_finder.sh -d domains.txt -o output.txt will append all validated subdomains from each domain listed in domains.txt to output.txt.

Explanation
-o output.txt:
The script accepts an -o option for specifying an output file. If this option is used, all validated resources from either a single domain (-u) or multiple domains (-d) are appended to the specified output file (output.txt in this case).

Appending Output:
The script appends the results to the OUTPUT_FILE with a newline after each domain's resources, ensuring clarity and separation between data from different domains.
